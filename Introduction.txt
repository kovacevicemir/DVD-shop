Dvd DeNiro application is .NET WPF based application that can export/import movies from .txt file and also add them manually via user interface.
This application consists of few xaml pages that are nested inside iFrame. iFrame is displayed inside MainWindow with pre defined margins.
By placing iFrame this way its, i was able to keep logo, menu and home icon at the top of user interface in every page.
I have decided to use Movie.cs class to store movies inside movies list. To display movies in movies list (Show movies) xaml page, application
iterate through movies list and display name,price,genre and year for each movie. DeNiro app. have some accessibility features
such as: tooltips, keyboard shortcuts and font+. Font+ is custom-made event that enables user to enlarge font in movies list page when Font+
is clicked. To make it more easy to use i have implemented event listener for 'ESC' key, which purpouse is to navigate to the homepage.
Menu has: Quit, Restart and Settings items. If you click on settings, new window object will be created and displayed to the user together with 
brightness and theme options. I havent implemented these settings features yet but i will in future.
